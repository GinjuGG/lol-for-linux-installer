# lol-for-linux-bash-installer
A bash (.sh) script that installs league of legends automagically! 

## My goals
- Finish up the bash script and make it as perfect and safe as possible
- Move to QTCreator and Python
- Make a nice GUI installer
- Polish it as much as possible 
- Flatpak it for easy use by new Linux users
